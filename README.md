# E-Commerce-Operations-Analytics
Hands-on operational analytics project
# 📦 E-Commerce Operations Analytics

**Status:** Active — hands-on  
🔗 Part of my independent analytics portfolio: https://wat-nxt.com/portfolio

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on **hands-on operational analytics using realistic e-commerce transactional data**, designed to simulate **Amazon-style raw datasets** rather than simplified or demo-ready data.

The primary objective is to practice **real-world data handling**, where datasets are messy, incomplete, and inconsistent, and must be cleaned and structured before meaningful analysis can be performed.

This is an **actively developed project**, evolving iteratively as data understanding and analytical requirements mature.

---

## 2. Problem Context

In real e-commerce environments, analysts rarely work with clean, ready-to-use datasets.  
Instead, they encounter:

- Raw transactional records  
- Missing and inconsistent values  
- Duplicate or partial orders  
- Inconsistent product and category naming  
- Operational anomalies across time  

This project was initiated to **replicate those real-world conditions** and build analytical discipline around data preparation and operational analysis.

## 3. Dataset Description

The dataset follows a **realistic Amazon-style transactional structure**, designed to resemble operational data feeds commonly seen in large e-commerce platforms.

### Dataset characteristics:
- Order-level and line-item-level records  
- Product, category, and pricing attributes  
- Transaction timestamps  
- Order status and fulfillment indicators  
- Intentionally incomplete and inconsistent values  

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
This is **not real Amazon internal data**.  
It is a **simulated dataset** created to behave like real-world e-commerce operational data.

## 4. Tools & Approach

### Current Implementation
- **Excel**
  - Initial data inspection
  - Manual validation
  - Pattern discovery
- **SQL**
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Filtering and joins
  - Aggregation and trend analysis

### Planned Extensions
- **Python** – automation and advanced transformations  
- **Power BI** – dashboarding and reporting  
- **Tableau** – alternative visualization workflows

## 5. Step-by-Step Analytical Workflow

### Step 1: Raw Data Inspection
- Understand table structures
- Identify missing and invalid values
- Detect duplicate and inconsistent records
- Validate date, numeric, and categorical formats

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
- Remove or flag invalid records
- Handle missing prices, quantities, and categories
- Standardize naming conventions
- Correct data type mismatches

### Step 3: Data Structuring
- Separate transactional and reference data
- Create analysis-ready views
- Establish relationships between:
  - Orders
  - Products
  - Categories
  - Time dimensions

### Step 4: Exploratory Analysis
- Sales trends over time
- Product and category performance
- Order volume patterns
- Operational inconsistencies and anomalies

### Step 5: Iterative Refinement
- Revisit assumptions
- Improve cleaning rules
- Refine query logic
- Gradually expand analytical scope

This workflow is **iterative**, reflecting real analytical practice.

## 8. What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to work with **raw, messy transactional data**
- Practical SQL-based data cleaning and transformation
- Operational analytics mindset
- Iterative analytical thinking
- Discipline in separating data preparation from insight generation

## 10. Notes

This repository emphasizes **process over polish**.  
The focus is on **how data is handled**, structured, and analyzed under realistic conditions, rather than only on final outputs.
